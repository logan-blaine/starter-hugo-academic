abstract: 'The causes of rate variation among sites within proteins are as yet poorly
  understood. Here, we compare the spatial autocorrelation of non-synonymous substitutions
  among species within diverse phylogenetic groups: Saccharomyces, Drosophila, Arabidopsis,
  and primates. Across these taxa, we find that amino acid substitutions exhibit excess
  clustering that extends over a 20-30 codon length (10-20 Angstrom distance) scale.
  We show that these substitutions cluster more strongly and exhibit compensatory
  dynamics within species lineages but exhibit patterns of convergent evolution between
  lineages. We evaluate a simple model of thermodynamic constraints on protein folding
  and conclude that it is unable to recapitulate the observed spatial clustering of
  substitutions. While pairs of substitutions with the strongest epistasis tend to
  spatially cluster in these simulations, the magnitude and length scale are smaller
  than that observed in real data. Additionally, we show that the pattern of convergent
  substitution is also not expected under this model, suggesting it is likely caused
  by factors other than these simple thermodynamic constraints. Our results support
  a prevalent role for epistasis and convergent evolution in shaping protein evolution
  across the tree of life.'
