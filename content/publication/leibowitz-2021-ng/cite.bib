 abstract = {Genome editing has therapeutic potential for treating genetic diseases and
cancer. However, the currently most practicable approaches rely on the
generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can give rise to a
poorly characterized spectrum of chromosome structural abnormalities.
Here, using model cells and single-cell whole-genome sequencing, as well
as by editing at a clinically relevant locus in clinically relevant cells,
we show that CRISPR–Cas9 editing generates structural defects of the
nucleus, micronuclei and chromosome bridges, which initiate a mutational
process called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is extensive chromosome
rearrangement restricted to one or a few chromosomes that can cause human
congenital disease and cancer. These results demonstrate that
chromothripsis is a previously unappreciated on-target consequence of
CRISPR–Cas9-generated DSBs. As genome editing is implemented in the
clinic, the potential for extensive chromosomal rearrangements should be
considered and monitored. Chromothripsis, a chromosomal shattering event,
can be elicited by micronuclei and chromosome bridges formed by
CRISPR–Cas9-generated double-stranded breaks. Extensive chromosomal
rearrangements may thus be an on-target effect of genome editing.},
