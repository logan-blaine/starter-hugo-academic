abstract: Genome editing has therapeutic potential for treating genetic diseases and
  cancer. However, the currently most practicable approaches rely on the generation
  of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can give rise to a poorly characterized
  spectrum of chromosome structural abnormalities. Here, using model cells and single-cell
  whole-genome sequencing, as well as by editing at a clinically relevant locus in
  clinically relevant cells, we show that CRISPR–Cas9 editing generates structural
  defects of the nucleus, micronuclei and chromosome bridges, which initiate a mutational
  process called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is extensive chromosome rearrangement
  restricted to one or a few chromosomes that can cause human congenital disease and
  cancer. These results demonstrate that chromothripsis is a previously unappreciated
  on-target consequence of CRISPR–Cas9-generated DSBs. As genome editing is implemented
  in the clinic, the potential for extensive chromosomal rearrangements should be
  considered and monitored. Chromothripsis, a chromosomal shattering event, can be
  elicited by micronuclei and chromosome bridges formed by CRISPR–Cas9-generated double-stranded
  breaks. Extensive chromosomal rearrangements may thus be an on-target effect of
  genome editing.
