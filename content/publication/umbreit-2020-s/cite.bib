 abstract = {The chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle is a mutational process
that produces gene amplification and genome instability. Signatures of BFB
cycles can be observed in cancer genomes alongside chromothripsis, another
catastrophic mutational phenomenon. We explain this association by
elucidating a mutational cascade that is triggered by a single cell
division error-chromosome bridge formation-that rapidly increases genomic
complexity. We show that actomyosin forces are required for initial bridge
breakage. Chromothripsis accumulates, beginning with aberrant interphase
replication of bridge DNA. A subsequent burst of DNA replication in the
next mitosis generates extensive DNA damage. During this second cell
division, broken bridge chromosomes frequently missegregate and form
micronuclei, promoting additional chromothripsis. We propose that
iterations of this mutational cascade generate the continuing evolution
and subclonal heterogeneity characteristic of many human cancers.},
