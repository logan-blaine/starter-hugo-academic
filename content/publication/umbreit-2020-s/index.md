abstract: The chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle is a mutational process
  that produces gene amplification and genome instability. Signatures of BFB cycles
  can be observed in cancer genomes alongside chromothripsis, another catastrophic
  mutational phenomenon. We explain this association by elucidating a mutational cascade
  that is triggered by a single cell division error-chromosome bridge formation-that
  rapidly increases genomic complexity. We show that actomyosin forces are required
  for initial bridge breakage. Chromothripsis accumulates, beginning with aberrant
  interphase replication of bridge DNA. A subsequent burst of DNA replication in the
  next mitosis generates extensive DNA damage. During this second cell division, broken
  bridge chromosomes frequently missegregate and form micronuclei, promoting additional
  chromothripsis. We propose that iterations of this mutational cascade generate the
  continuing evolution and subclonal heterogeneity characteristic of many human cancers.
