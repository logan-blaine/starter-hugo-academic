      I completed research rotations with Shamil Sunyaev, Jason Buenrostro, and Luca Pinello. I also took rigorous graduate-level courses in probabilistic modeling, statistical inference, and machine learning including:
      - Probability I (STAT 210)
      - Algorithms for Inference (MIT 6.438)
      - Bayesian Modeling and Inference (MIT 6.435)

  - title: Associate Computational Biologist 
    company: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

      I analyzed single-cell genomics data for cancer biology research as a part of the [Pellman Lab](https://pellmanlab.dana-farber.org/). With co-mentorship from [Cheng-Zhong Zhang](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/cheng-zhong-zhang), I helped show how errors in cell division can cause genomic catastrophes frequently occurring in cancer and less commonly seen after CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. 
     
  - title: Undergraduate Student 
    company: Princeton University
    company_url: 'https://www.princeton.edu'

    description: |
      I majored in Molecular Biology and earned certificates in [Applications of Computing](https://ua.princeton.edu/academic-units/program-applications-computing) and [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://ua.princeton.edu/academic-units/program-quantitative-and-computational-biology). For my senior thesis, I worked with [Peter Andolfatto](https://www.biology.columbia.edu/people/andolfatto) on *in silico* modeling of protein evolution. 
      I also served as the president of the Princeton University Cycling Club.
