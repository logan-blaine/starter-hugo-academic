Hi! My name is Logan (he/him) and I am a graduate student in the [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics PhD Program](https://bigphd.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School. For my thesis research, I am working in the [Pinello Lab](https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/) to build computational tools for functional genomics and single-cell assays. **My goal is to accelerate biomedical discoveries by developing statistical and machine learning approaches to analyze the latest high-throughput  biological assays.**
